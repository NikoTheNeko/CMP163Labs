Part 1
 - I made a tiny island with a mountain in the back.
 - There's different levels of spikeyness to each of the spheres
 - The mountain is the most pointy one and all the way in the back
 - I made a little forest too which uses a less intense version of the displacement shader
 - and the sand is also a even less intense version of the displacement shader
 - I made trees by putting the wave shader on a sphere and putting them on a stick
 - I also made a new skybox again
 - and my own textures for everything
 - pretty epic!

Partner stuff
 - My partner did a cool little beach with the ocean andd stuff.
 - The mountains in the back look a little bit foggy which is cool
 - I love the trees they made!
 - The waves look like they're crashing against the water and it's so cool
 - The rocks look cute
 - Learned that you can use the displacement shader in different ways, like the clouds!
