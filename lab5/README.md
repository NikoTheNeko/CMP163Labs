I made a new particle that looks like sparks that follow behind the player and it glows and it looks sick.
I edited the track to showcase the new mods and stuff.
I put billboards and put pictures on them.
I made little stone arcs.
I also created a new skybox with a sun on the top smiling down on the player.
I made new materials and gave it to all of the objects in the games. I used the normal maps on some of the materials to give them cool effects like rock and the grass.
The clouds glow blue.
I changed the music to something more calming. :)
I also made another new particle that looks like a white droplet. This was so you can edit the colors in engine.
You can go through the Color Waterfalls to see the different kinds of colors you can assign it.
There's also the little spinny circle ramps that showcase the color over time variable with the water droplets so it looks like a rainbow
pretty epic if you ask me.
